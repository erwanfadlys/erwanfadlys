# 👋 Hi, I’m @erwanfadlys 
Half of my life i dedicate to oil and gas. Covid slap me 😵‍💫 with reality and I think its time for me to take a break and learn something new. 
I am really interested in python due to its object oriented programming and hate C. There's no workaround on that but I had to learn it anyway. 
2021 is the year where I decide to pursue degree in Information tech. Being old and boring, hopefully this will not be so bumpy road. 

Wish me luck on my journey ✌️
